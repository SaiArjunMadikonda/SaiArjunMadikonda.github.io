## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Sai Arjun Madikonda

IT professional with 4+ years operating at the intersection of data, infrastructure, and automation â€” designing resilient systems, streamlining DevOps workflows, and solving for scale. At Tech Mahindra and BNY Mellon, I've led enterprise-level initiatives across SQL Server environments, architected high-availability solutions, automated CI/CD pipelines with GitLab and PowerShell, and implemented real-time observability using SQL Sentry, Splunk, and SolarWinds.

Backed by a Master's in Business Analytics from the University of Maryland, I bring a data-driven mindset grounded in predictive modeling, machine learning, and advanced visualization. My academic journey has also led to multiple published papers on AI in agriculture, cryptography, and privacy-preserving data mining â€” bridging the gap between research and applied technology.

Whether it's optimizing performance, integrating complex systems, or just shaving seconds off a query plan, I care deeply about clean execution and meaningful outcomes. I'm always in pursuit of building smarter, faster, and more secure systems that stand up to real-world demands.
